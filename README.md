This is just an experiment to see what I can make in Java. Don’t take it too seriously and don’t blame me.
Autumn is a lightweight Java dependency injection (DI) and application framework inspired by Spring Boot. I’m just curious about what they did. Now, it provides a component-based architecture with automatic bean management, lifecycle hooks, and a simple package-scanning mechanism.
